Snippet: FormItBuilder

Version: 1.3.3 pl

A small framework to assist in quick development of FormIt forms and emails. Using a snippet (with some basic PHP commands) a complex form can be built much faster, and can automatically use the jQuery plugin "Validation" methods

FormItBuilders main purpose is to act as a wrapper to simplify much of the FormIt syntax and automatically build forms and email chunks dynamically without the need to duplicate HTML code and FormIt tags. If the output is not 100% appropriate for the job, FormItBuilder can output the raw form HTML to be used and modified as needed (like any FormIt form). Likewise email output can also be output in this same manner.

To use follow the instructions below and check out the example snippet. There will be much more functionality and help information to come.
